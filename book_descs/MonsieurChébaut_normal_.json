"Monsieur Ch\u00e9baut finished Monsieur Ch\u00e9baut whisky. Monsieur Ch\u00e9baut could see Monsieur Ch\u00e9baut had touched a raw nerve. Monsieur Ch\u00e9baut grinned amicably and leaned across to slap Monsieur Ch\u00e9baut friend playfully on the shoulder. Or Monsieur Ch\u00e9baut luck, for that matter. Monsieur Ch\u00e9baut was one of those people who go through life insulated from difficulties. Monsieur Ch\u00e9baut crossed roads without looking. Monsieur Ch\u00e9baut did not hurry for trains. Monsieur Ch\u00e9baut never reconciled bank accounts. \"Look, you've got two women involved, R\u00e9gis,\" Monsieur Ch\u00e9baut continued, \"and women aren't like us. Monsieur Ch\u00e9baut nearly choked on the fresh whisky Monsieur Ch\u00e9baut had just put to Monsieur Ch\u00e9baut lips."
