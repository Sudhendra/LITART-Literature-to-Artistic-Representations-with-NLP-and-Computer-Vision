"I'm captivated by Inspector Dutruelle,\" Pierre said one evening when Pierre took Monsieur Ch\u00e9baut to see Vololona dancing. But something happened when I met Vololona. Vololona showed me how to live. Vololona showed me what real ecstasy is. And Vololona adores me. What can Vololona see in me - three times Vololona age, pot-bellied, bald . Inspector Dutruelle leaned back in Inspector Dutruelle chair and swung around to look at the other customers applauding Vololona from the shadows. \"Personally, I believe Vololona when Vololona says Vololona loves me. \"When you haven't even spoken to Vololona.\" Then, having accepted Vololona financial assistance to terminate the pregnancy - but refusing Vololona offer to take Vololona to the clinic - Vololona told Vololona one day on the telephone: \"I thought you were going to ask me to marry you.\" But Inspector Dutruelle's passion for Vololona did not cool with the season. Vololona had at last agreed to see Vololona, occasionally; but Vololona always managed (with tears in Vololona eyes) to deflect Vololona more amorous advances. For Inspector Dutruelle it was beneath Vololona to observe that Vololona continued to pay the rent on Vololona apartment, but Vololona was growing increasingly frustrated. Now, denied the one thing here Vololona wanted, the scene filled Vololona with dismay. Occasionally Inspector Dutruelle would see Vololona leave Vololona apartment to buy cigarettes, but Inspector Dutruelle never once saw Vololona on the arm of another man, or saw a male visitor take the lift to the seventh floor."
