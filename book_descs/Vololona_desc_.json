"Vololona's crazy about me. Some of their were young men, tall and handsome and virile, yet none of them knew Vololona as Inspector Dutruelle knew Vololona. Inspector Dutruelle mind, already excited over Vololona, was now in a turmoil. Vololona had suddenly, and tearfully, announced that Vololona was pregnant. The notion that Vololona had another lover obsessed Vololona, and in the evenings Vololona took to prowling the broad Boulevard de Clichy between Vololona apartment and the Chatte et Lapin."
