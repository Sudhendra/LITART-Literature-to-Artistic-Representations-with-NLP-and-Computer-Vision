Agnes intends to keep you.\" But anyway, Agnes just laughs and says Agnes can't believe it.\" \"Sometimes I wonder if I ought to tell Agnes something, if only out of decency.\" \"No,\" Monsieur Ch\u00e9baut cried with a passion that surprised the Inspector, \"never, you must never tell Agnes. \u00c9coute R\u00e9gis, even if Agnes did mention it, you must deny everything. Even if Agnes caught the two of you in the act, you must deny it. \"I thought you'd leave Agnes,\" Poor Agnes replied. \"I wanted to be with Poor Agnes. It seemed that the more you gave women the more women took, until there was nothing left to give but Poor Agnes."
